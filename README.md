# Electricity Coverage by Districts of Pakistan

## Project Overview
This project showcases a heat map created using QGIS to visualize the electricity coverage across various districts of Pakistan. The project is part of my ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate skills in data analytics, geographic information systems (GIS), and data visualization.

## Data Source
**Source:** Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM)  
**Description:** The data used in this project represents the percentage of electricity coverage across different districts in Pakistan. It's important to note that the data might not be entirely accurate due to the inherent limitations of the source.

## Files Included
**Electricity Coverage by Districts.qgz:** The QGIS project file containing the layers and configurations used to create the heat map.  
**Electricity Data by Districts.xlsx:** The Excel file with the raw data on electricity coverage by district.  
**Electricity Coverage by Districts.png:** The final output image of the heat map showing the electricity coverage.  
**pak_admbnda_adm2_wfp_20220909.shp:** The shapefile representing the district boundaries of Pakistan.  
**pak_admbnda_adm1_wfp_20220909.shp:** The shapefile representing the provincial boundaries of Pakistan.  
**pak_admbnda_adm0_wfp_20220909.shp:** The shapefile representing the whole map of Pakistan.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to create a visually compelling and informative heat map that could be used to analyze and compare electricity coverage across Pakistan's districts. This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with GIS data and produce meaningful visualizations.

## Tools & Technologies
**QGIS:** Used for creating the heat map and managing geographic data.  
**Excel:** Used for managing and preparing the raw data before importing it into QGIS.

## How to Use
### Cloning the Repository
**Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal and run the following command:  
`https://github.com/Ramzan-Asif/QGIS-Electricity-Coverage`  
**Navigate to the Project Directory:** Move into the directory where the project files are located:  
`cd Electricity-Coverage-Pakistan`
### Using the Project
**Open the QGIS Project:** Launch QGIS on your system. Open the Electricity Coverage by Districts.qgz file within the QGIS application.  
**Explore the Data:** Examine the layers, symbology, and data configurations used to create the heat map. You can modify, add, or remove layers according to your needs.  
**View the Map:** The heat map should load automatically, displaying the electricity coverage across Pakistan.  
**Further Analysis:** Use the included shapefiles (Districts.shp, Provinces.shp, PakistanMap.shp) to extend your analysis or create additional visualizations.
